# NLP-Natural-Language-Processing

Welcome to my NLP repository! This repo contains various natural language processing (NLP) topics and projects, including fundamental concepts like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and more. You will also find hands-on projects that apply these concepts.

## NLP Concepts

This section contains basic NLP techniques and methods. Each topic is explained in detail within a Jupyter notebook.

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into tokens (words, sentences, etc.)
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form.
- **Lemmatization**: Normalizing words into their base form.
- **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: Representing text as word counts.
- **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, a method to measure word importance.

You can explore these concepts individually in the provided notebooks.

## Projects

### Spam Classifier

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not. The classifier is trained using natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF.

- **Folder**: `Spam_Classifier/`
- **Description**: Check out the detailed [README](./Spam_Classifier/README.md) in the project folder for a full breakdown.

### Sentiment Analyzer

The sentiment analyzer project classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using various NLP techniques.

- **Folder**: `Sentiment_Analyzer/`
- **Description**: Full details are available in the project's [README](./Sentiment_Analyzer/README.md).
